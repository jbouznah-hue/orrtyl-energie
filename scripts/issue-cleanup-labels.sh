# One-time script to clean up issue labels.
# Run locally with an authenticated `gh` CLI:
#   bash scripts/issue-cleanup-labels.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Deletes typo / stale / obsolete labels
#   2. Renames labels that are miscategorized
#   3. Removes all "type: *" labels (replaced by GitHub issue types)
#
# Safe to run multiple times (idempotent).
